# InitGit

git init initializes a git repository. However, that is usually one of several steps involved in hooking up a project to Git. There are often more steps involved. Nevertheless, these steps are repetitive. 

## Installation

Use the node package manager [npm](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install `initgit`.

```bash
npm install initgit
```

## Usage

```bash
$ initgit
```
